I am a finance profressional focused on building teams that drive profitable growth, manage financial risks, and increase operational transparency.  I am passionate about using technology to empower analysts and business teams, especially small-scale tools that can radically improve team effectiveness while minimizing complexity and cost of deployment.  I am a voracious problem-solver skilled in synthesizing inputs from diverse sources to identify, define, and resolve complex business challenges.
