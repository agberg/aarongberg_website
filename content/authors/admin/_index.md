I am a finance profressional focused on driving profitable growth, managing financial risks, and increasing operational transparency.  I have a track record of developing talent across the teams and organizations that I work with.

I am passionate about using technology to empower analysts and business teams, especially "small scale tools" that can radically improve team effectiveness while minimizing complexity and cost of deployment.  Finally, I am a voracious problem-solver skilled in synthesizing inputs from experts and sources to identify, define, and resolve complex business challenges.
